## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Stage coexists with prod; dev is disjoint by construction
The stage project SHALL be startable while the prod project runs on the same host. Stage's
subnets, `container_name`, volumes, and published ports SHALL differ from prod's. Dev uses
a single app subnet, and ports distinct from both. Each project's `db` network SHALL have its own
pinned subnet: `172.28.12.0/24` for prod, `172.28.22.0/24` for stage, and `172.28.31.0/24` for
dev. Each project's `supabase` network (pinned `172.28.13.0/24` prod, `172.28.23.0/24` stage,
`172.28.32.0/24` dev) and `edge` network (pinned `172.28.14.0/24` prod, `172.28.24.0/24` stage,
`172.28.33.0/24` dev) SHALL be its own. Its Postgres and Supabase storage volumes SHALL be
scoped to that project. Each environment's `SUPABASE_PORT` SHALL differ from every other
published port of every environment on the host.

The router's trusted-proxy gateways SHALL be read from `ROUTER_FRONT_GW` and
`ROUTER_BACK_GW`. They default to `172.28.10.1` and `172.28.11.1`, so production's adapted
router configuration is byte-identical. `compose.yaml` SHALL NOT set either variable.
Wherever either is set, its value SHALL be a single dotted IPv4 address.

#### Scenario: Stage beside prod
- **WHEN** the prod stack is up and `make stage-up` runs
- **THEN** stage starts without a network-pool overlap or container-name conflict, and
  prod's containers are not recreated

#### Scenario: Each environment has its own Postgres
- **WHEN** the dev and stage stacks are both up
- **THEN** each has its own `db` container, data volume, and `db` network, and neither `db`
  can reach the other
- **AND** each has its own Supabase gateway on its own `SUPABASE_PORT`, and a request to one
  gateway never reaches the other environment's services

#### Scenario: Production router defaults unchanged
- **WHEN** the Caddyfile is adapted with neither gateway variable set
- **THEN** the adapted JSON equals the committed baseline (`make check` invariant 13), and
  `docker/scripts/test_router.sh stage` passes

### Requirement: Static invariant check
`docker/scripts/check-envs.sh` SHALL resolve each environment with
`docker compose config --no-env-resolution`, with every profile enabled so that tool services
are checked too, using placeholder `--env-file`s it writes to a
temporary directory. It SHALL never contact Infisical, and SHALL never read or print `.env`,
`.env.dev`, `.env.stage`, or any `.env.infisical.*` file.

It SHALL fail, naming the violated invariant, when any of the following holds:
1. A published port in any project is not bound to `127.0.0.1`.
2. A dev or stage port is `8080`.
3. A dev published port is not a gate port.
4. A dev bind mount violates the dev data and secret rule (its read-only exceptions
   included).
5. A `packages/*/src` directory is not mounted.
6. A dev posture pin is not a literal in the raw file, or resolves to a different value.
7. Stage's or prod's `REQUIRE_LOGIN=1` is missing or has a different value.
8. Stage mounts a host path under the home directory.
9. A compose file resolves, without `-p`, to a project name other than its declared one.
10. A router gateway variable is set in `compose.yaml`, or is set anywhere to a value that
    is not a single dotted IPv4 address.
11. `docker/.env` exists.
12. The companion ignore file does not begin with an exclude-all line.
13. The Caddyfile adapted with no gateway variables differs from the committed baseline.
14. Any service in the dev, stage, or prod project has an `env_file`.
15. The key names listed in the shared allowlist file differ from the null-passthrough names
    of the resolved prod `api` or dev `app`, excluding keys that service pins with a literal.
16. In any of the dev, stage, or prod projects:
    - a service other than `db`, `migrate`, `auth`, `rest`, `realtime` and `storage` joins the `db` network, or
      `db` or `migrate` joins any other network;
    - a service other than `supabase-gw`, `auth`, `rest`, `realtime` and `storage` joins the `supabase`
      network, or a service other than `supabase-gw` joins the `edge` network, or `supabase-gw`
      joins `db`;
    - a Supabase service other than `supabase-gw` publishes a port, or `supabase-gw` publishes
      anything other than one `127.0.0.1` port mapped to its listener;
    - the `db` or `supabase` network is not internal, does not isolate the host from it (no host
      address on the bridge), or is not on that environment's pinned subnet; or the `edge` network
      is not on its pinned subnet;
    - the image of `db`, `migrate`, `auth`, `rest`, `realtime`, `storage` or `supabase-gw` is not
      pinned by `@sha256:` digest;
    - the placeholder value given for any Supabase secret appears anywhere (environment, command,
      labels, healthcheck, build arguments, or any other field) in a service outside that
      secret's allowed set:

      | Secret | Allowed services |
      | --- | --- |
      | `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` | `db`, `migrate`, `realtime` |
      | `SUPABASE_ROLES_PASSWORD` | `db`, `auth`, `rest`, `storage` |
      | `JWT_SECRET` | `auth`, `rest`, `realtime`, `storage` |
      | `ANON_KEY` | `supabase-gw`, `realtime`, `storage` |
      | `SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` | `supabase-gw`, `storage` |
      | `SECRET_KEY_BASE`, `REALTIME_DB_ENC_KEY` | `realtime` |

It SHALL need only `docker`, `jq`, and a POSIX shell.

#### Scenario: A LAN-published port is caught
- **WHEN** the dev compose file is edited to publish `0.0.0.0:8787:8787`
- **THEN** `make check` exits non-zero and names the dev port binding

#### Scenario: An overridable pin is caught
- **WHEN** the dev compose file is edited to `HOST: ${DEV_HOST:-127.0.0.1}`
- **THEN** `make check` exits non-zero and names the non-literal pin

#### Scenario: A reintroduced env file is caught
- **WHEN** `env_file: .env` is added back to the prod `api` service
- **THEN** `make check` exits non-zero and names invariant 14

#### Scenario: Allowlist drift is caught
- **WHEN** a passthrough key is added directly to the prod `api` service instead of the shared
  allowlist file
- **THEN** `make check` exits non-zero and names invariant 15

#### Scenario: A published Postgres port is caught
- **WHEN** `ports: ["127.0.0.1:5432:5432"]` is added to `db`
- **THEN** `make check` exits non-zero and names invariant 16

#### Scenario: The Postgres password leaking to the app is caught
- **WHEN** `DATABASE_URL: postgres://postgres:${POSTGRES_PASSWORD}@db/postgres` is added to the
  dev `app` environment
- **THEN** `make check` exits non-zero and names invariant 16

#### Scenario: Another service on the db network is caught
- **WHEN** the dev `companion` service is joined to the `db` network
- **THEN** `make check` exits non-zero and names invariant 16

#### Scenario: The superuser password in a service-role service is caught
- **WHEN** `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` is referenced in the `rest` service's environment
- **THEN** `make check` exits non-zero and names invariant 16

#### Scenario: The gateway on the db network is caught
- **WHEN** `supabase-gw` is joined to the `db` network
- **THEN** `make check` exits non-zero and names invariant 16

#### Scenario: A host-reachable supabase network is caught
- **WHEN** the `supabase` network's `internal: true` is removed
- **THEN** `make check` exits non-zero and names invariant 16

#### Scenario: Clean tree passes
- **WHEN** `make check` runs on the committed files
- **THEN** it exits zero
