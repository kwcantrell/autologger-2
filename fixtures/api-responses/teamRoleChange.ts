// GENERATED — DO NOT EDIT BY HAND.

// Captured from a real `POST /api/teams/:id/members/:uid/role` response by
// `server/src/routers/apiResponseFixtures.int.test.ts` and re-asserted
// against the live handler on every server test run
// (web-api-shape-conformance, design D2/D3).
//
// Regenerate with:  npm run fixtures:capture -w server
//
// Emitted as a `.ts` module rather than `.json` because the client type this
// fixture checks contains a string-literal union: a JSON import widens
// `"admin"` to `string` and would fail the conformance assignment for a
// reason that has nothing to do with the server (design D4's verified
// wrinkle). `as const` preserves the literal; `Mutable` puts back the
// mutability `as const` takes away.
//
// Unstable values (uuids, timestamps, clock readouts) are redacted to `#` by
// the capture helper — see `server/src/test/apiFixtures.ts` for why they are
// redacted in place rather than deleted or wildcarded.
